When do use If and when do use Whether? Let's take a look. The simple rule is that with conditional sentences we use If, and when we have two options we use Whether. If i get hungrey, i'll have a snack. But i don't konw whether to have an apple or a biscuit. When asking an indirect yes/no question, we can use either If or Whether, both are correct. Do you know if the apples are fresh? Do you know whether the biscuits are any good? Wherther is maybe a lit bit more formal, but with both questions, there are only two possible answers - yes or no. Why don't you try now? Write us a question or a sentence using if or whether **in the comments** to practise, we love hearing from you.
